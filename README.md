# Improving J-divergence of brain connectivity states by graph Laplacian denoising

This repository contains the code needed to perform the most important analyses in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11240.pdf . Here, we present a novel denoising algorithm based on graph Laplacian which improves the separability between two connectivity states. We introduce an original version of the Jensen divergence in order to measure the statistical distance between obsevations under two hypoteses.
